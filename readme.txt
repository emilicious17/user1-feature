readme.txt file for deliverable 2
Written by Nicolette

This deliverable is built upon the broken code that was submitted for deliverable 1
For this project, the type of socket must be defined in the last variable entered on the command line. "UDP" or "stream"

Nicolette attempted to communicate with the group multiple times to deligate tasks.
Everyone picked and agreed to respective tasks on Tuesday

Afham and Faraz took parts 1-3 with the promise of being done by Wednesday or letting the group know.
Not only did they not finish, we have not heard anything from them since. The rest of the group believes
that they have given up and are no longer going to be helping with the project.
One text was recieved by Nicolette from Faraz asking about the echo_c part and who was in charge of it. Nicolette's attempts at responding/helping were met with silence

Syed and Emnet took parts 4 & 5. Only contact has been with Emnet, complaints about not knowing how to start, and any attempt at helping them has been meet with silence. 

Nicolette and Kent took parts 6-8. They met several times throughout the week to work on the Deliverable
When they finished, Nicolette started working on other files such as the Makefile and the readme file since
it did not appear as if anyone else was even going to finish their respective parts.
Nicolette added the pieces of code to server_function.c that has her name by the comments, and modified the entirety of log_s 
which was based on code pulled from the tutorial website. There should be a comment at the top of the file saying this and giving a link to the website.
She also modified server_function.h because one of the functions was missing from deliverable one
Kent researched on the socket tutorial website to find what functions did what and how their syntax worked. He also deciphered code as Nicolette
was writing it to minimize mistakes/bugs.

The Makefile was written by Nicolette and Kent. Changing names of files and making sure files had their .h files as dependencies

Friday Kent and Nicolette decided to try and do the other parts of the project by themselves since the rest of the group did not seem to be working on it at all.
Kent took parts 4&5 while Nicolette attempted parts 1,2&3. 
Sunday Kent and Nicolette met up once more to try and get everything collected together for submission.
They texted the group multiple times (as this was the agreed upon form of communication), but recieved no response.
Nicolette gave parts 1-3 her best shot before helping Kent with parts 4&5.

Faraz and Afham did upload code late Sunday night for echo_s, but the code did not have all the parts necissary and could not be used.
No changes were made to the client code except for changing its name to echo_c because no other changes were needed. No changes were made to the client function files

No testing could be done under the time constraint.

Basically the entire project was written by Nicolette with help from Kent in areas.
